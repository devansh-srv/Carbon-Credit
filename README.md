# Introduction and Motivation

In India under section 135 of the Companies Act (2013), corporations must spend 2% of their average net profit from the preceding three years on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). 
However, many companies resort to "greenwashing" rather than making genuine societal contributions. Simultaneously, NGOs face inadequate funding, limiting their ability to execute impactful projects.

A decentralized Carbon Credit system leveraging blockchain can address these challenges. 
It ensures timely funding for NGOs, promotes transparency and accountability in CSR activities, and aligns corporate efforts with genuine societal and environmental betterment.

## History
Carbon trading originated in the 1990s as a market-based solution to combat climate change, starting with the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, which introduced emissions trading among countries.
It later evolved into voluntary markets and cap-and-trade systems, allowing companies to trade carbon credits globally.
